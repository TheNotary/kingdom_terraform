# Persistent Infrastructure

With some apps, you need to persist data between re-spins.  And some infrastructure you never want to respin, like DNS zones (respining those will require you to re-point your domain to new registrats and lead to down time due to caching at the DNS level).  So put persistent infrastructure in this folder.
